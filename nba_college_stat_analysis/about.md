## NBA and the Data

The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the men's professional basketball league in North America, composed of 30 teams. It is considered the "premier basketball league in the world." The NBA has an annual draft, called the NBA draft, which NBA teams can draft eligible players into the league. These players are typically college players, but international players are also eligible to be drafted. The game of basketball is rather complex, with 5 players on each team competing on the court to make as many points as possible while trying not to commit fouls.

Many statistics are measured about an NBA player, like their field goal percentage, three-point shot percentage, rebounds, assists, and so on. These statistics are used to award players and are the main show for people wanting to predict how well a player will do in the league. For this project, our focus will be on the players that were drafted in the NBA draft from college and how their performance compared with their college level performance and (if possible) later-NBA performance. We will be using two player statistics: the [Player Efficiency Rating](https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/per.html) (PER) and [Win Shares](https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/ws.html), both from the site Basketball Reference.

The data for players in the NBA is scraped from [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com). The college player statistics is scraped from [Sports Reference College Basketball](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/).
